Six CSV files were provided to conduct a research on  employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s.

<ins>**Objective**<ins>

Perform Data Modeling, Data Engineering and Data Analysis.

<ins>**Data Modelling**<ins>

CSV files were inspected to sketch out an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables.
[Quick Database Diagrams](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com) was used to design the ERD.

<ins>**Data Engineering**<ins>

Table schema was designed for the six CSV files and the files the imported into the corresponsing 
SQL table in a PostgreSQL database.

<ins>**Data Analysis**<ins>

`SQL queries` were designed to query the database for the following:
1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.

2. List employees who were hired in 1986.

<ins>**Further Analysis**<ins>

The SQL database was imported into a pandas dataframe. SQL Alchemy was used to make the connection with PostgreSQL database.

A histogram was created to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees. 
A bar chart of average salary by title was also created.
